# fdf
## “fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project
![Alt text](/screenshots/42.jpg?raw=true "42")
A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate models. More features planned!
## Compiling and running
Run ``make``. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run it with ``./fdf [map]``. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the ``test_maps`` directory. The one in the screenshot above is ``test_maps/42.fdf``.
